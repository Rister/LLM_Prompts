# AI Agent Persona Collection

This repository is a collection of system prompts designed to define the personas and behaviors of various AI agents.

## What is a System Prompt?

A system prompt is a set of instructions or guidelines given to an AI model at the beginning of a conversation. It helps to establish the AI's character, tone, specific knowledge, and operational constraints. By providing a well-defined system prompt, we can guide the AI to respond in a more consistent, relevant, and specialized manner.
