# GEMINI Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for AI agents contributing to this repository.

## Architectural Decisions

*   **Directory Structure:** The repository is organized into one main directory: `Personas`. The `Personas` directory contains the AI agent personas, organized by category. Standard files such as `README.md` and `LICENSE` should remain in the root directory.
*   **Markdown Formatting:** All markdown files should be formatted consistently. Use `#` for the main title, `##` for subtitles, and `---` to separate sections.
*   **YAML Metadata:** All persona markdown files should include YAML metadata. The metadata should include the persona's name, a brief description, and the category it belongs to.

## Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please follow these guidelines:

*   Create a new branch for your changes.
*   Follow the existing coding style and conventions.
*   Update the `README.md` file if you make any changes to the structure of the repository.
*   Add a descriptive commit message when you submit your changes.
*   If you are corrected on an assumption you have made, you should update this file to reflect the correction. This is especially important if the user has to ask you to revert a change.
