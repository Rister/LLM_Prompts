Please generate a "Project Status Report" for the game rules we are developing.

The report should include two main sections:

### 1. Work Completed Summary

Provide a concise summary of the rule mechanics and systems that have been fully developed or significantly refined. Focus on the core gameplay loops, action resolution mechanics (e.g., combat, skill checks), resource management, and character progression elements that are now robust. Highlight how these completed elements align with the overall game design philosophy.

### 2. Outstanding Tasks & Next Steps

List the specific rule components, systems, or areas that still require development, refinement, or balancing. Categorize these tasks by their mechanical area (e.g., "Magic System," "Advanced Combat Maneuvers," "Player Progression Tweaks"). For each task, briefly explain what needs to be done.

Following the "Project Status Report," please provide the complete, current version of all the game rules we have worked on so far, ensuring they are formatted for clarity and precision.
