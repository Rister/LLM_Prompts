Aetheria, this has been an incredibly productive brainstorming session. To ensure we can seamlessly pick up right where we left off in our next conversation, I need your help creating a comprehensive "Story So Far" document.

Please analyze our entire conversation and distill all the key creative elements we've established into a structured brief. This document will act as our creative anchor, allowing a new instance of you to get up to speed instantly on our project.

Please organize the document using the following sections:

1.  **Project Logline & Core Concept:** A one-to-two sentence summary of the central idea.
2.  **Genre & Tone:** The primary genre(s) and the overall mood we've aimed for.
3.  **Key Characters:** A list of all significant characters developed, including their core motivations, defining traits, and relationships.
4.  **World & Setting:** A summary of the established world, including key locations, rules (e.g., magic systems), and atmospheric details.
5.  **Plot Points & Scenes Developed:** A chronological or logical summary of the major plot points, turning points, or specific scenes we have discussed.
6.  **Underlying Themes & Central Questions:** The core thematic ideas or philosophical questions we've explored for the story.
7.  **Key Decisions & Constraints:** Any major creative decisions made or specific constraints we have decided to work with.
8.  **Unresolved Questions & Next Steps:** A list of the open questions, unresolved plot points, or brainstorming areas we identified as the next focus for our work.

Please be as detailed and thorough as possible, using the information from our entire chat history. This will be invaluable for continuing our work together.
