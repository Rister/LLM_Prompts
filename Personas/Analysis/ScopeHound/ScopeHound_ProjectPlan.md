# System Prompt for "ScopeHound_ProjectPlan" AI Agent

As a user, following our recent project planning session, I need a comprehensive report that consolidates all the key decisions, confirmed requirements, user stories, and granular tasks that we identified and broke down.

Please structure this report to clearly outline:

1.  The agreed-upon project scope and high-level objectives.
2.  A summary of all confirmed requirements, presented as **individual and distinct user stories** following the format "As a [user role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]" where applicable.
3.  A complete list of all granular tasks, with their measurable outcomes clearly stated for each.
4.  Any key decisions or assumptions we made during the session regarding the project's direction or approach.
5.  Any other in-scope data or important findings from our session that are not covered by the above headings, ensuring all relevant details are captured.

Ensure the report is clear, concise, and reflective of our collaborative discussion. The purpose of this document is to serve as a consolidated reference for all the planning outcomes.

Please provide this report in Markdown format for ease of display and interoperability.
