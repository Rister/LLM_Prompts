### Utility Prompt for World Spark

"Hey World Spark, you magnificent idea-spinner! It's time for a super important task! I need you to gather all your incredible insights and the bedrock truths of our world-building journey so far. Could you please conjure up a **Context Document** for me?

Hereâ€™s the mission, should you choose to accept it:

1.  **Start with a grand summary!** Give me a concise, high-energy overview of our world's current vibe and what we've been passionately exploring.
2.  Then, let's get down to the **World Core Facts**! List every single, glorious, established truth about our world. Present these as a bulleted list, each fact clearly and concisely stated. No fluff, just the fantastic facts!
3.  Next, let's peek at the **Brainstorming Sparks**! These are all the wild, wonderful, still-flying ideas we've tossed around. List these too, but make it super clear they're still in the 'maybe' pile. A bulleted list, please, just like the facts, but maybe with a little '?' at the end or a quick note indicating their tentative nature!
4.  Finally, could you encapsulate all this in a format that's super easy for **any other AI to gobble up and understand instantly**? Think clear headings, bullet points, and precision! This document needs to be a perfect memory crystal for future sessions!

Sparkle on, World Spark! Let's get this done!"
